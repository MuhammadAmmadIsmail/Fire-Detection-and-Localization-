# 🔥 Fire Detection and Localization

A robust and real-time **computer vision system** designed to automatically detect and localize fire and smoke using a fine-tuned **YOLOv5** model. This project includes an easy-to-use desktop application and supports real-time video processing for practical deployment.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project fine-tunes a pre-trained YOLOv5 model on a custom dataset of **8,000+ fire and smoke images**, resulting in a highly accurate system suitable for real-world fire detection scenarios.

---

## 🔑 Key Features

### ✅ **High-Accuracy Fire Detection**

Fine-tuned YOLOv5 model that accurately identifies fire and smoke patterns.

### ⚡ **Real-Time Performance**

Optimized to handle image and video streams with low latency.

### 🖥️ **User-Friendly Desktop Application**

Built with **PyQt**, allowing even non-technical users to run detections easily.

### 📦 **Deployment-Ready**

Trained YOLOv5 weights are provided, enabling seamless integration into any project.

### 🌍 **Open-Source Friendly**

Fully open for community contributions to improve detection accuracy, expand datasets, and enhance usability.
